Hi there! I'm Jiaqi Sun (孙嘉琦), an incoming Ph.D. student in sociology at Stony Brook University. I earned my B.A. in sociology from Minzu University of China and my M.A. in sociology from Renmin University of China. My research interests include political sociology, comparative-historical sociology, political economy, and cultural sociology.
